 Abstract
- Traditional authentication (passwords, PINs, tokens) is vulnerable to phishing, breaches, and hygiene risks (e.g., contact-based biometrics).
- Proposed solution: Two-Layer Contactless Physical Authentication System using face + voice biometrics for secure, touch-free identity verification.
- Applications: Access control, attendance tracking, secure logins.
- Core tech: ArcFace (facial embeddings) + ECAPA-TDNN (voice embeddings), fused via a decision engine.
- Goal: Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on cost-effective embedded hardware for practical, widespread use.

 Introduction
 Overview
- Growing need for robust identity verification; traditional and single-factor biometrics are insufficient.
- Multimodal biometrics (face + voice) significantly increase security and resilience against spoofing.

 Problem Statement/Objectives/Goals
- Security Vulnerabilities: Passwords/PINs easily compromised; single biometrics can be spoofed.
- Hygiene Concerns: Contact-based systems risk germ transmission.
- Lack of Accessibility: High-security systems are often expensive and proprietary.

Project Objectives:
1. Investigate state-of-the-art deep learning models for facial recognition and speaker verification.
2. Develop modular pipelines for face detection/embedding and voice embedding.
3. Integrate pipelines with a decision fusion engine.
4. Implement anti-spoofing (liveness detection) to prevent photo/recording attacks.
5. Build an MVP on cost-effective embedded hardware.
6. Evaluate performance using biometric metrics (FAR, FRR).

 Deliverables
1. Working Proof-of-Concept Application: Functional software demonstrating two-factor authentication on MVP hardware.
2. Comprehensive FYP Final Report: Detailed documentation of background, methodology, design, testing, and results.
3. Source Code Repository: Documented Git repo with all code and integration logic.
4. Final Presentation & Live Demo: Summary presentation and live prototype demonstration.
